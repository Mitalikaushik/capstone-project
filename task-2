task -2 
 given a application:
server.jsn, node.jsn

need to write down docker file for it
FROM node: 16
COPY ..
RUN npm install
RUN npm build
CMD ["npm", "start"]

1. Dockerfile
2. docker build .> image
3. docker run -it -p p1(can be anything):p2(depends on the process that you see in the logs) image-id
4. ec2 ip:p1
5. push the image to ECR

6. write a deployment yaml and service.yaml using Loadbalancer
hit loadbalancer from the browser - "hello world" 

they are asking how many node groups do we have - 2
so they are asking for 1 more group that have taints
so you need to add one more node group in eksctl file - copy the node in eksctl file
- apply taint using 
below label
taints:
      - key: anything
        value: "c37"
        effect: NoSchedule
7. new nodegroup in eksctl (ideally should be in private subnet)
8. eksctl create ng -f filename
9. deployment.yaml with tolerations
10. service.yaml
11. lb - "hello world"
