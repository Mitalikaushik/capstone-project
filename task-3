stateless - if you are making any changes in pod, those changes are there till the time the container is alive.
as soon as you you kill the pod, the changes will be lost.
- to persist that changes we use docker volume
we need to deploy stateful state
1. deploy a stateful set of redis - helm - refer redis.yaml
( if you are entering some data to redis, the new data should compe up, not lost)
2. Enter some data into statefulset - using RedisCli command 
3. i will create a redis pod [kubectl run redis --image redis]
4. delete the statefulset pods - new pods will come up
5. try to retreive the data
